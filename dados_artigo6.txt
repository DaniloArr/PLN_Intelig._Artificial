Objetivo: this paper, we propose a cyber-attack detection algorithm and present an impact analysis 
of easy-to-launch cyber-attacks on a low-power mote (z1 zolertia) 
as a model iot device.;;
Metodologia:  such a secure message passing technique should be designed for these low powered devices along with cyber-attack detection.;;
Problema:  contributions 
considering these limitations an d requirements , there is a 
need for an algorithm that will provide security and overcome 
resource limitations. contributions

Contribuicoes:
 contributions considering these limitations an d requirements , there is a need for an algorithm that will provide security and overcome resource limitations.
 interference present in the environment can also contribute to these changes in energy consumption.
