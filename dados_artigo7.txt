Metodologia:  however, the existing risk 
assessment methods are either qualitative in nature or employ 
probabilistic models to study the impact on only one system 
layer. hence, i n this work , we propose a  quantitative risk 
assessment method  for cyber -physical systems b ased on  
probabilistic and deterministic techniques. using the proposed method,  
combined risk metric s are calculated that consider the 
likelihood and impact of cyber threat scenario s. thereby, t he proposed method 
identif ies the most critical substations  and assets that must be 
cyber secured. to a ssess  the risk of cyber  attacks 
on the cyber -physical system, a holistic approach is needed that 
considers both system layers . hence, i n this work , we propose a  quantitative risk 
assessment method  for cyber -physical systems b ased on  
probabilistic and deterministic techniques.;;
