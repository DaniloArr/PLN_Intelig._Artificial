Objetivo: this paper, temporal difference learning algorithm which is a 
known prediction-based machine learning approach, is 
enhanced and used for implementing path planning and obstacle avoidance in a known environment with static obstacles.;;
Metodologia:  it is observed that 
computational complexity is less in the proposed approach 
compared to the conventional method. in this work, an 
approach called modified temporal difference learning for 
path planning and obstacle avoidance is proposed for static obstacles. it is observed that 
computational complexity is less in the proposed approach 
compared to the conventional method.;;
Problema: — robotic navigation is a crucial issue for any robotic 
based automation. in order to implement a seamless robotic 
navigation, path planning is a key challenge in robotic navigation.;;
